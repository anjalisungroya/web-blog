                  <div class="content"><p>We can’t know what is coming and we need to enjoy every day instead of trying to “arrive.” We should enjoy the unfolding and the process.                  
                  It’s so much easier said than done. Each one of us spent so much of my time in just trying to get to the next best thing.                 
                  When I can buy the next house. When I get married. When I get promoted. When I have a baby. When will I figure this $@*% out       
                  And while there isn’t anything wrong about wanting things in your life or having aspirations, sometimes those goals and dreams do distract us from the beauty in the daily moments.
                  We’ve been doing this our entire life….focusing on the destination more than the journey.
                  The<b> destination</b> matters, but the <b>journey</b> makes it all worthwhile.</p>
                 <p><b>Life is a Journey, so…</b>
                    Stop caring about what other people think. They aren’t thinking about you nearly as you as much as you think they are. Not even close. 
                    Whatever is mortifying you right now, won’t matter when you’re grown. In fact, if it’s embarrassing you, it’s probably building character. The kind of character that you’ll need later in life.                    
                    Just be yourself. Really, truly, yourself.
                    Take more shots. You can’t score if you don’t shoot the ball.                     
                    What inspires you? What are you curious about? Do more of that! If you want to try art, but you don’t have any friends in art, take art anyway.                    
                    Stop following the crowd. At some point or another, you will be led astray. Do what you think is right; what you think you should do. 
                    Be kind. Always.</p>
                 <p><b>There Must Be Growth...</b>
                      The journey is about growth. It’s about living. And learning. These are only a handful of the lessons I’ve learned along the way.                     
                      And while I wouldn’t go back and give myself answers, I would give myself advice:                      
                      Enjoy the Journey. Don’t worry about the destination. Things work out. Be yourself. Love more.

                  <b><i>“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”</i></b> Too many times we keep thinking and talking through our goals. 
                Instead we need to learn to start taking action....<span class="details">read more</span>
                <div class="content"><p>We have different goals and different wants. We also have different ways on getting these wants and goals. 
                 The way you will know if you will succeed or fail is if you do something about it.</p>
                 <p>Wishes, hopes, and dreams – yes, we all have them. The difference is some choose to daydream about them while others choose to do something. 
                   Most of us may ask ourselves, how do we start? Where do we start? We get these questions and often take time away from actually doing something about it.
                  It’s just like what Walt Disney said, “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”</p>
                 <p>We encounter people saying, “I plan to do this next week” or “I actually want to try that but can’t find the time to”. 
                  All these statements just hinder them from actually starting what they want to do. Instead of all the talking, why not act on it? 
                  The only way you get something done is by doing something. We will only see results once we take the first step of doing something.</p>
                 <p>In order to succeed in any field, you have to start with actions. You need to do something about your goal and your wants. 
                   We will never accomplish anything sitting around and waiting for luck and chance to grace our presence. We are responsible for our dreams and goals. 
                   Only we, can make things happen.
